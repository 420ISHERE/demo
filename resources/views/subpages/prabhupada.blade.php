            <p> Srila Prabhupada, the spiritual visionary behind the global Hare Krishna Movement, is revered as the Acharya and initiating guru of ISKCON. With unwavering 
                determination, he dedicated his life to spreading the profound message of Krishna Consciousness across the globe. His life stands as a shining example of spiritual courage and transformational leadership. </p>
            
            <p> At the age of 70, Srila Prabhupada set sail for New York with a heart full of faith and a mission to fulfill his guru’s instruction—to share Vedic wisdom with the 
                Western world. With little money, minimal support, and only a suitcase of books, he started from a modest office in New York and went on to ignite a global spiritual 
                movement now known as the <b>Hare Krishna Movement</b>. </p>

            <h4 class="mb-4">A Journey of Devotion and Purpose</h4>
            <p>Born on <b>1st September 1896</b> in Calcutta as <b>Abhay Charan De</b>, he graduated from Scottish Church College in 1916 and married in 1920. His life took a spiritual turn in <b>1922</b>, 
                when he met his guru, <b>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura</b>, who urged him to preach Krishna consciousness in the West. Eleven years later, in 1933, he was formally initiated 
                as <b>Abhay Charanaravinda Dasa</b>. </p>
            <p>In <b>1944</b>, amid World War II, he single-handedly launched <b>Back to Godhead</b>, a spiritual magazine that still thrives today in over <b>40 languages</b>, reaching more than <b>a million 
                readers worldwide</b>. Recognizing his deep spiritual realization and scholarship, the Gaudiya Vaishnava society awarded him the title "<b>Bhaktivedanta</b>" in 1947. </p>

            <h4 class="mb-4">The Sannyasa Years and the Historic Voyage</h4>
            <p>In <b>1950</b>, Srila Prabhupada embraced <b>vanaprastha</b>, retiring from married life to focus on deep study and writing. He spent six years at the <b>Radha-Damodara temple in Vrindavan</b>, where 
                he began translating and commenting on the <b>Srimad Bhagavatam</b>—his life’s magnum opus. He accepted <b>sannyasa</b> (renounced order) in <b>1959</b>, solidifying his full-time commitment to his 
                spiritual mission. </p>
            <p> In <b>1965</b>, he boarded the cargo ship <b>Jaladuta</b>, enduring a tough 40-day voyage to America. Arriving in New York City with just <b>40 rupees</b>, a trunk full of books, and unshakable 
                determination, Srila Prabhupada gradually attracted seekers with his wisdom, simplicity, vegetarian cooking, and soulful chanting of the <b>Hare Krishna mantra</b>. </p>

            <h4 class="mb-4">The Global Movement Begins</h4>
            <p>In <b>July 1966</b>, he officially established the <b>International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)</b>. Within just <b>11 years</b>, he founded <b>108 temples</b> across six continents, 
                wrote <b>over 70 books</b>, and initiated <b>more than 10,000 disciples</b>. He circled the globe <b>14 times</b>, tirelessly sharing the timeless message of Bhakti Yoga. </p>
            <p>Srila Prabhupada’s legacy continues to touch millions of lives, offering a path of joy, wisdom, and spiritual fulfillment. His life reminds us that with 
                faith, courage, and devotion, even the most impossible dreams can be realized.</p>
