                Apara Ekadashi is considered very powerful in eliminating sinful reactions. This article describes the
                benefits of following this Ekadashi as narrated by Lord Krishna to King Yudhishthira in the
                <em>Brahmanda Purana</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                King Yudhishthira once inquired from Lord Krishna about the Ekadashi that occurs during the dark
                fortnight
                (Krishna Paksha) of the month of Jyeshtha (May–June). Lord Krishna, appreciating the inquiry, replied,
                “O King, this Ekadashi is so sublime and meritorious that even the greatest sins can be effaced by
                observing it.
                Its name is Apara Ekadashi.”

                Lord Krishna said, “One who fasts on this holy day gains universal fame. Even sins such as killing a
                Brahmana, cow, or embryo; blasphemy; or illicit relations are completely counteracted by observing
                Apara Ekadashi.” When observed in the right spirit of devotion, it burns away sinful reactions by
                awakening one’s Krishna consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lord Krishna continued, “Those who bear false witness, cheat others, or act dishonestly in their
                profession
                are destined for punishment. But by observing Apara Ekadashi, all such sinners can be freed from their
                sinful reactions.” Integrity, honesty, and devotion are uplifted through this sacred observance.

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
            Lord Krishna further said, “Warriors who flee the battlefield are sent to a ferocious hell. But even such a
            fallen Kshatriya attains heaven if he fasts on Apara Ekadashi. A disciple who blasphemes his spiritual
            master suffers immensely, yet even he can attain liberation by observing this Ekadashi.”
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
            The Lord emphasized that the merit gained by observing Apara Ekadashi equals performing numerous sacred
            acts:
            bathing in holy rivers like Pushkara, Prayag, and Gaya; worshipping Lord Shiva in Varanasi; donating cows,
            elephants, and gold; and visiting Kedarnath and Badrinath. Observing Apara Ekadashi bestows all these
            pious results combined.
        </p>


        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" data-aos="fade-up">Apara Ekadashi – The Destroyer of Sins</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
            Lord Krishna beautifully described the purifying power of this day using vivid imagery:
            “Apara Ekadashi is an axe that cuts down the forest of sins, a forest fire that burns the trees of misdeeds,
            a radiant sun that removes the darkness of ignorance, and a lion that devours the deer of impiety.”
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
            He concluded, “O Yudhishthira, whoever fears his past and present sins must observe Apara Ekadashi strictly.
            One who neglects it will be reborn in material existence again and again.”
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" data-aos="fade-up">The Worship of Lord Trivikrama</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
            Lord Krishna instructed, “One must faithfully observe Apara Ekadashi and worship Lord Trivikrama
            (Vamana-deva). Whoever does so is freed of all sins and promoted to the abode of Lord Vishnu.
            Whoever hears or reads the glories of Apara Ekadashi is also purified of all sinful reactions.”
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" data-aos="fade-up">Observing Apara Ekadashi</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">
            Devotees observe Apara Ekadashi by increasing devotional activities such as chanting the Holy Names,
            reading scriptures like <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>, and serving the Lord with devotion.
            Since Lord Vamana’s pastime of covering the universe with His two steps occurred on this day,
            devotees often read about this from the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (Canto 8, Chapter 20).
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="700">
            On this day, one should avoid grains, pulses, and beans, and instead take simple offerings like fruits,
            milk, and non-grain foods. The key principle is purity of consciousness and devotion to Lord Krishna.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800" class="mt-4 text-center fw-semibold">
            Apara Ekadashi is a day of blissful spiritual austerity. By observing it sincerely,
            one can attain immense spiritual benefits and the mercy of Lord Vishnu.
