                Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura describes Vīrabhadra Gosāñi as the direct son of Śrīla
                Nityānanda Prabhu and a disciple of Jāhnavā-devī. His real mother was Vasudhā. In the
                <em>Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā</em>, verse 67, he is mentioned as an incarnation of Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu.

                Two devotees of Lord Caitanya, named Śrī Rāmadāsa and Gadādharadāsa, always lived with Śrī Vīrabhadra
                Gosāñi. Śrī Rāmadāsa, later known as Abhirāma Ṭhākura, was one of the twelve gopālas, cowherd
                boyfriends, of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. The <em>Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā</em>, verse 126, states that Śrī
                Rāmadāsa was formerly Śrīdāmā.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <em>Bhakti-ratnākara</em> (Fourth Wave), there is a description of Śrīla Abhirāma Ṭhākura. By the
                order of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Abhirāma Ṭhākura became a great ācārya and preacher of the Caitanya cult
                of devotional service. He was a very influential personality, and non-devotees were very afraid of him.
                Empowered by Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, he was always in ecstasy and was extremely kind to all fallen souls.
                It is said that if he offered obeisances to any stone other than a śālagrāma-śilā, it would immediately
                fracture.

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" data-aos="fade-up">Khānākūla-kṛṣṇanagara</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
            Ten miles southwest of the Cāṅpāḍāṅgā railway station on the narrow-gauge railway line from Howrah, in
            Calcutta, to Āmtā, a village in the Hugalī district, is a small town named Khānākūla-kṛṣṇanagara, where the
            temple of Abhirāma Ṭhākura is situated. During the rainy season, when this area is inundated with water,
            people must go there by another line, which is now called the southeastern railway. On this line, there is a
            station named Kolāghāṭa, from which one has to go by steamer to Rāṇīcaka. Seven and a half miles north of
            Rāṇīcaka is Khānākūla. The temple of Abhirāma Ṭhākura is situated in Kṛṣṇanagara, which is near the kūla
            (bank) of the Khānā (Dvārakeśvara River); therefore this place is celebrated as Khānākūla-kṛṣṇanagara.

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" data-aos="fade-up">Bakula Tree</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
            Outside of the temple is a Bakula tree. This place is known as Siddha-bakula-kuñja. It is said that when
            Abhirāma Ṭhākura came there, he sat down under this tree.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" data-aos="fade-up">Fair in Caitra Masa</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
            In Khānākūla-kṛṣṇanagara there is a big fair held every year in the month of Caitra (March–April) on the
            Kṛṣṇa-saptamī, the seventh day of the dark moon. Many hundreds and thousands of people gather for this
            festival.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5" data-aos="fade-up">The Whip of Abhirāma Ṭhākura</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
            The temple of Abhirāma Ṭhākura has a very old history. The Deity in the temple is known as Gopīnātha. There
            are many sevaita families living near the temple. It is said that Abhirāma Ṭhākura had a whip and that
            whoever he touched with it would immediately become an elevated devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Among his many disciples,
            Śrīmān Śrīnivāsa Ācārya was the most famous and the most dear, but it is doubtful that he was his initiated
            disciple.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
            When Nityānanda Prabhu was ordered to go to Bengal to preach, these two devotees [Śrī Rāmadāsa and Gadādhara
            dāsa] were ordered to go with Him. Thus they are sometimes counted among the devotees of Lord Caitanya and
            sometimes among the devotees of Lord Nityānanda. Rāmadāsa, one of the chief branches, was full of the
            fraternal love of Godhead.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-5 text-center fw-semibold" data-aos="fade-up">
            Let us remember the extraordinary devotion of Śrī Abhirāma Ṭhākura and seek his mercy to serve the Supreme
            Lord with faith and humility.
