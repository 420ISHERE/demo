                    <p>
                        Recently, I came across a video where nurses were being trained on how to care for elderly
                        patients.
                        The goal was not just medical, but emotional: to cultivate empathy, patience, and understanding
                        by helping
                        them see the world through the eyes of those who struggle with limitations.

                    </p>
                    <p>This got me thinking: in spiritual life too, we often forget to wear the lens of empathy.</p>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes, when we feel steady in sadhana, we may unconsciously develop a sense of superiority.
                        We might look down upon those who are struggling in Krishna consciousness—struggling due to past
                        conditioning, disturbed minds, old habits, or even deep emotional wounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By learning to see the world from another devotee’s perspective, we develop empathy,
                        appreciation,
                        and patience. Rather than criticizing those who fall short, we admire the fact that despite such
                        odds, they are still holding on to Krishna.

                    <p>
                        Let us cultivate humility and introspection. Let us appreciate even small attempts others make
                        to stay in Krishna consciousness despite their struggles. And let us rise above the urge to feel
                        superior by dragging others down.

                    <p class="fw-bold text-dark">
                        May we always remember that the real battlefield is not in others' lives—but in cleansing our
                        own hearts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In one lecture, HG Madhu Pandit Prabhu beautifully explained how fault-finding directly destroys
                        our faith.
