            <p><strong>Goddess Radha</strong>, the best we can call is Shree Radha Rani, our heart was born on Ashtami
                of Badhrapada, according to the Hindu Panchang. And the day is celebrated as <strong>Radha
                    Ashtami</strong>. She is a conscious form of pure love, and lord Shree Krishna indicate her as his
                heart.</p>

            <p>They are the god and goddesses of love. Krishna reincarnated after Radha Rani. The birthday of Krishna ji
                came before 15 day of Radha rani. The Veda and the Matbhagvat Gita mention Radha as almost one year
                older than Krishna. She is the reincarnation of the Goddess Lakshmi from “Gau lok”.

            <h3 class="mt-5">Brief About Shree Radha Rani</h3>
            <p>Goddess Radha is eternal love, and the source of divine love to every being. The only form of expression
                of love starts after “Raasleela”. She is called with different names such as: Brijbhan Dulari, Barsane
                Vali, Shree Virindavn Swamini, Sri Rashesvari and many more.</p>

                about her, one thing is clear: she is different from the Aksar Brahma, and she is the only way to
                salvation, according to many Indian sages. </p>
