                In ancient times there were two brothers named <strong>Hiranyakashipu</strong> and
                <strong>Hiranyaksha</strong>.
                They were demons born to sage Kashyapa Muni. They flaunted uncommon bodily features and had steel-like
                frames
                which grew just like mountains. Their bodies became so tall they seemed to kiss the sky with the crests
                of
                their golden crowns. They blocked the view in all directions, and while walking shook the earth with
                their every step.
            </p>
            <p>
                The younger demon, <strong>Hiranyaksha</strong>, was a greedy exploiter of gold. He exploited enough
                gold from the earth
                so as to cause it to spin out of orbit. It then fell into the ocean.

            <p>
                Lord Brahma, the creator of the Universe, was thinking of how to lift the earth which was submerged in
                water.
                At this time, the small form of a boar came out of his nostril. The measurement of the creature was not
                more than
                the upper portion of a thumb. While Brahma was looking at it, that boar became situated in the sky like
                a gigantic
                elephant. Then the boar roared like a rolling mountain. Brahma and the other demigods who saw this came
                to know
                that He was an incarnation of <strong>Lord Krishna</strong> and offered their prayers.

            <p>
                Playing like an elephant, Lord Varaha (the boar) flew in the sky, slashing His tail, His hard hairs
                quivering.
                He scattered the clouds in the sky with His hooves and glittering white tusks. As Lord Krishna had
                assumed the
                form of a boar, He searched for the earth by smell. Diving into the water like a giant mountain, He
                split the
                ocean into two huge waves. Lord Varaha penetrated the water with His hooves, sharp like arrows.
            </p>
            <p>
                There He saw the earth, the resting place for all living beings, lying as it was in the beginning of
                creation.
                Then He easily took the earth on His tusks and lifted it out of the water. With His anger glowing like
                molten coals,
                Lord Varaha then accosted the demon Hiranyaksha.
            </p>

            <h2 class="fw-bold text-primary">Lord Varaha Kills Hiranyaksha</h2>
            <p>
                Thereupon Lord Varaha killed the demon within the water, just as a lion kills an elephant. The cheeks
                and tongue
                of the Lord became smeared with the blood of the demon, just as an elephant becomes reddish from digging
                in the purple earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this manner, the Personality of Godhead, Lord Krishna—the maintainer of all living entities—raised
                the earth
                from within the water, and having placed it afloat on the water, He returned to His own abode.
