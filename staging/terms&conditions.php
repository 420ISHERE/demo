                        signed
                        by our donors in the donor forms, both offline and online. But in case of an unlikely event
                        of
                        an erroneous deduction or if the donor wants to cancel/deduct the donation, we will respond
                        within 7 working days from the date of receiving the complaint from donor. The timely refund
                        of
                        the wrongly deduced amount will depend on type of card used during transaction. We would

                        a proof of deduction of the donation amount and a written communication for refund from the
                        donor within two days after donation.
                        <br>
                        In such cases if the receipt already has been issued, then the donor needs to return the
                        original receipt at our official address.
                        <br>
                        In the case of tax exemption certificate already issued, refund will not be possible.

                        <br>
                        Please note that international donations will require more working days for refund.
